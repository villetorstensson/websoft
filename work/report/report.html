<h2>S01</h2>
<p>Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</p>
    <p>I had worked in Github before, but mainly in the desktop version of it. So Git bash and all the commands
        were a bit new for me. Markdown and Github pages had I never worked with before. We have had a couple of 
        courses where we used Git, and I have always found it a bit tricky and hard to manage. So hopefully this time
        it will be a different experience for me, considering I am using Git Bash.</p>
    
    <p>Have you ever created websites before?</p>
    <p>I have worked a bit with client and server in the course network applications so I know a bit about setting
        up a server. But i have never tried making a website or worked with websites before. So this will probably be
        a fun challenge working with some new languages. </p> 
    
    <p>Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</p>
    <p>As written above, I had some experience of web application development in a previous course. But other than
        that, this is pretty new for me. I know some stuff about it like Websockets and Restful APIs, but I have never
        worked with Visual Studio Code or anything like that before.</p>
    
    <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p>My TIL for this course section is mainly some new commands in Git Bash. I learned about the Github Pages aswell
        as some new commands in Git Bash such as tags. I also learned how to manage this program I am writing this in,
        Visual Studio Code. Other than that, I also learned about how to use links in the index.html to get to other
        html files.</p>
