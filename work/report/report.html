<h1>Reports from the course</h1>


<section>
<h2>S01</h2>
<p>Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</p>
    <p>I had worked in Github before, but mainly in the desktop version of it. So Git bash and all the commands
        were a bit new for me. Markdown and Github pages had I never worked with before. We have had a couple of 
        courses where we used Git, and I have always found it a bit tricky and hard to manage. So hopefully this time
        it will be a different experience for me, considering I am using Git Bash.</p>
    
    <p>Have you ever created websites before?</p>
    <p>I have worked a bit with client and server in the course network applications so I know a bit about setting
        up a server. But i have never tried making a website or worked with websites before. So this will probably be
        a fun challenge working with some new languages. </p> 
    
    <p>Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</p>
    <p>As written above, I had some experience of web application development in a previous course. But other than
        that, this is pretty new for me. I know some stuff about it like Websockets and Restful APIs, but I have never
        worked with Visual Studio Code or anything like that before.</p>
    
    <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p>My TIL for this course section is mainly some new commands in Git Bash. I learned about the Github Pages aswell
        as some new commands in Git Bash such as tags. I also learned how to manage this program I am writing this in,
        Visual Studio Code. Other than that, I also learned about how to use links in the index.html to get to other
        html files.</p>

<h2>S02</h2>
<p>Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</p>
    <p> No I do not have any previous experience of any of these 3 languages. So hopefully I will master all of them during this course.</p>
    
    <p>Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</p>
    <p> I can try to explain with an example: HTML: Human body comprising bones, it is the skeleton and flesh.
        CSS: This is the accessories like clothes, make-up and glasses. Things that makes you look extra good.
        JavaScript: Everything involving your movement, how you laugh and run for example.
        So basically you will need all of these three to work properly as a human being. And it works the same in web development.
        For example if you dont have JavaScript, you will have clothes and a body but you cannot do anything. 
        And if you dont have CSS, you will not have any clothes or accessories, that is kind of wierd.
        And if you dont have HTML, your clothes and accessories are useless because you dont have a body to put them on.
    </p> 
    
    <p>Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</p>
    <p> A browser communicates with the web server trough HTTP protocol. 
        If a browser wants to return something to the web server, a picture for example, it makes a HTTP request to a web server. And then the server returns the request. 
    </p>
    
    <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p> My TIL for this course section is: I learned how to work with pictures in visual studio code. I learned how change background
        color for my different pages on my web site. I also learned how to change fonts in my web site.  </p>
