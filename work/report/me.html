<p> Here is a short presentation of who I am.
</p>

<p> My name is Ville Torstensson, I am 21 years old and I live in SÃ¶lvesborg and have lived there my whole my life. It is a small city in Blekinge, half an hour drive from Kristianstad.
    When im not in school or studying I am probaly playing football, hanging out with my friends and girlfriend or playing some video games.  
</p>

<p> I don't have a lot of working experience in my life due to the fact that I started studying at HKR right after I graduated high school. 
    But hopefully i graduate from the university this summer and then I can begin my working life for real.
</p>

<p>My favourite hobby of mine is probably playing golf, right now the weather is not optimal for golf so therefore I am waiting for the spring to come with some nice weather so I can start golfing again.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading my short presentation. Have a nice day!</p>
