<h1>Reports from the course</h1>


<section>
<h2>S01</h2>
<p>Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</p>
    <p>I had worked in Github before, but mainly in the desktop version of it. So Git bash and all the commands
        were a bit new for me. Markdown and Github pages had I never worked with before. We have had a couple of 
        courses where we used Git, and I have always found it a bit tricky and hard to manage. So hopefully this time
        it will be a different experience for me, considering I am using Git Bash.</p>
    
    <p>Have you ever created websites before?</p>
    <p>I have worked a bit with client and server in the course network applications so I know a bit about setting
        up a server. But i have never tried making a website or worked with websites before. So this will probably be
        a fun challenge working with some new languages. </p> 
    
    <p>Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</p>
    <p>As written above, I had some experience of web application development in a previous course. But other than
        that, this is pretty new for me. I know some stuff about it like Websockets and Restful APIs, but I have never
        worked with Visual Studio Code or anything like that before.</p>
    
    <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p>My TIL for this course section is mainly some new commands in Git Bash. I learned about the Github Pages aswell
        as some new commands in Git Bash such as tags. I also learned how to manage this program I am writing this in,
        Visual Studio Code. Other than that, I also learned about how to use links in the index.html to get to other
        html files.</p>

<h2>S02</h2>
<p>Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</p>
    <p> No I do not have any previous experience of any of these 3 languages. So hopefully I will master all of them during this course.</p>
    
    <p>Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</p>
    <p> I can try to explain with an example: HTML: Human body comprising bones, it is the skeleton and flesh.
        CSS: This is the accessories like clothes, make-up and glasses. Things that makes you look extra good.
        JavaScript: Everything involving your movement, how you laugh and run for example.
        So basically you will need all of these three to work properly as a human being. And it works the same in web development.
        For example if you dont have JavaScript, you will have clothes and a body but you cannot do anything. 
        And if you dont have CSS, you will not have any clothes or accessories, that is kind of wierd.
        And if you dont have HTML, your clothes and accessories are useless because you dont have a body to put them on.
    </p> 
    
    <p>Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</p>
    <p> A browser communicates with the web server trough HTTP protocol. 
        If a browser wants to return something to the web server, a picture for example, it makes a HTTP request to a web server. And then the server returns the request. 
    </p>
    
    <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p> My TIL for this course section is: I learned how to work with pictures in visual studio code. I learned how change background
        color for my different pages on my web site. I also learned how to change fonts in my web site.  </p>
</section>

<h2>S03</h2>
<p>Do you have any previous experience of client side Javascript?</p>
    <p> I have never worked with javascript before, so therefore my experience with it is very minor. 
        But I have worked with client and server side applications before, so therefore I know a bit about
        how to handle the client side. </p>
    
    <p>Can you compare and relate the Javascript language to any other language you know? </p>
    <p> Yes, I have almost only worked with Java before. And after working with JavaScript now it feels like 
        the 2 languages are very similar. I understand most of the code and variables in JavaScript, so it 
        seems like a good language to start working with after working in Java.  
    </p> 
    
    <p>Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be? </p>
    <p> I actually started this coding exercise with creating the duck. I coded a duck that move to the right when you click on it.
        I decided to start with this because I felt I needed more knowledge about the fetch-part before i could start working with it.
        When I had gathered some information regarding the fetch, I started by doing a table in my js-file. 
        I had some struggles with the fetch part, but I looked at the code in examples and got some help from there.
        Because I hade some struggles with the fetch I only did the requirements for grade 3, but if I get some 
        more time with it I will try to expand it. 
    </p>
    
    <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p> First of all i learned how to make a movable object in javascript, using an eventlistener.
        I learned about the fetch command, which i had some issues with.
        And in the fetch-part I also learned how to create a HTML-table and style it.
        I also learned more about how json works. </p>

<h2>S04</h2>
<p>Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</p>
    <p> I have very little experience in node and npm. I have never worked with it before so therefore
        I had some troubles understanding it at first.  </p>
    
    <p>How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</p>
    <p> So far I have learned a lot in this course and it has been very nice working with JavaScript. Node and
        Express have I only worked with a little bit now in this section, but so far it has been pleaseant.
        And hopefully it will continue to run smooth in future sections.
        
    </p> 
    
    <p>Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</p>
    <p> I started with doing the tasks before the actual coding exercise, installed Node and npm and got familiar with it.
        Then I completed the Express application with help from the example folder. Then it was time to make the lottery-game.
        I searched after some insipiration online and found some good tips and tricks before I started coding myself.
        This assignment went well and without any big issues.
    </p>

    <p>What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</p>
    <p> I only did the requirements for grade 3. I started trying with the grade 4 requirements but decided
        not to proceed with it because it got to difficult for me. I felt that grade 3 was a pretty easy level considering
        you hade most of the code for it.  
    </p>

    
    <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p> Considering I never worked with node and npm before thats one thing i learned.
        I also learned how to work with Express. </p>

<h2>S05</h2>
<p>How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?</p>
    <p> It seems like a useful language to learn. Struggled a bit with it at first but now I am starting 
        to understand it a bit more. </p>
    
    <p>Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</p>
    <p> It is a bit similar to Java. 
    </p> 
    
    <p>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</p>
    <p> I started by looking at some of examples in the folders. I then customized the code in functions.php, config.php,
        and search.php to make it fit my agenda. I then went onto phpMyAdmin where I created my database. I then
        created a table person, where i inserted some different persons with ids, names and age. Then I created a auto 
        incremented integer as primary key. Since I am not the best at databases, I settled for grade 3 in this section.
    </p>

    
    <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p> My TIL for this course section is the php language. 
        I also learned to work in phpMyAdmin.  </p>

<h2>S06</h2>
<p>What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts of future popularity among programming languages?</p>
    <p> What i believe is that the most popular programming languages are often the ones that have been around for a while.
        It is hard to create a new language and make it a popular programming language right away. For that
        to happen the language has to offer something incredible and new. So I believe that in the future
        the popular languages like C or Java will probably grow even more and be as popular as ever.
        And hopefully som new language with some new techniques has established as a very popular language.  </p>
    
    <p>What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?</p>
    <p> That is a hard question to answer because I have not worked that much with different languages. So 
        I will have to wait until I can know the answer to this for sure. I will adapt to whatever language 
        my workplace uses the most. And I will probably work more with the front-end part of programming. So HTTP
        could be my choice for the future. 
    </p> 
    
    <p>Do your own investigation on https://trends.google.com (Links to an external site.) to customize your own comparison on programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results.</p>
    <p> I decided to compare PHP with JavaScript, and it turned out that these 2 languages has been pretty stable for the last
        5 years. With JavaScript being the most popular of the 2 during these 5 years. And it looks like it will continue 
        in that way, with JavaScript having a slightly positive curve, and PHP having a pretty neutral curve. 
    </p>

    
    <p>If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”?</p>
    <p> I would probably recommend JavaScript due to the fact that it is a popular and great language. 
        So finding competent people for it would not be hard.  </p>

        <p> What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p> I had never used Google trend before so I learned that.   </p>

<h2>S07</h2>
<p>Try to explain the platform .NET (C#, ASP.NET) to a skilled programmer, but newbie to this Microsoft technology.</p>
    <p> It is basically a platform where you can build many different types of applications.
        You can use 3 different languages, C#, F# and Visual basic. You can create many different 
        types of applications, for example for the web, mobile and desktop.  </p>
    
    <p>Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we learned during the course.</p>
    <p> Compared to php I feel like .net is more compatible with C#. It seems easier to learn and get going with
        .net then with php.
    </p> 
    
    <p>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</p>
    <p> I aimed for grade 3 as usual. 
        I started with downloading dotnet so I could get familiar with that. Then I used your lecture on youtube
        as an guide to get going with the assignment. And after that I got some assistant from other youtube videos 
        aswell.  
    </p>

        <p> What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p> Dotnet is my TIL for this course section.  </p>

<h2>S08</h2>
<p> Group members: Ville Torstensson, Felix Karström, Martin Rubin.
        Websites chosen: Aftonbladet, Expressen, Kristianstadbladet.  </p>
        <p> We chose these websites because they are very similiar in their content. So it will be
            interesting to compare them. </p>

            <p> Findings and elaboration </p>
            <p> The best of our three websites was definitely Expressen, it loaded the fastest, and performed best
                on almost every aspect. Aftonbladet was not very far behind, as it also was a quick and good website.
                Kristianstadbladet on the other hand, was not very close to the other two websites. It was a slow 
                website compared to them. 
                
                We used pagespeed to see the biggest problems of the websites and how to solve them.
                Aftonbladet had a quick site and could not improve that much. The biggest time-saver they could
                do is to eliminate render-blocking resources, and thereby save 1.07 seconds. They could also improve
                some image-problems. But overall they have a very quick site.
                Expressens website is excellent, their only time-saver would be to defer offscreen images. But other 
                than that, their website runs very quick. 
                Kristianstadbladet has some very bad statistics compared to Aftonbladet and Expressen. Their website runs 
                significally slower and could save a lot of time on some issues. They could save 11.25 seconds on serving
                images in next-gen formats. And 10.92 seconds on defering offscreen images.
                  </p>

<h2>S09</h2>
<p>Elaborate on a few (3-5) different security issues or concerns, 
    from your own experience, related to web application security and relate them to the OWASP top ten.</p>
    <p> When it comes to security issues the one thing im most concerned about is all the data websites 
        are collecting about you these days. When you create a new account somewhere they store all of 
        your information you entered by using cookies and other tools. If a database is hacked all of your 
        personal information can be accessed. Another security issue is passwords. Nowadays people are signed
        up to a lot of different platforms, and most of us are probably using the same password for each platform. 
        You need to make sure that your password contains a lot of different characters, otherwise 
        hackers got algorithms that can breach your password in just a couple of hours. I change my password 
        once in a while just to make sure I am not using the same password for too long. 
        Another security risk could be if you are visiting some old site and they are not up to date with security 
        protocols.   </p>

    <p> Summarize by providing your own guidelines to a new web programmer on the topic 
        “The essential guidelines to follow to create secure web applications”.</p>
    <p> Learn the OWASP top 10 and have them in mind while programming. 
        Always be aware that security issues could be everywhere, you are never completely safe of them. 
        When implementing code, try to always think about the security concerns.  </p>

    <p> What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p> I learned about what the biggest security issues are in web programming.  </p>
