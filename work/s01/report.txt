Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?
Yes I had worked in Github before, but mainly in the desktop version of it. So Git bash and all the commands
were a bit new for me. Markdown and Github pages had I never worked with before. We have had a couple of 
courses where we used Git, and I have always found it a bit tricky and hard to manage. So hopefully this time
it will be a different experience for me, considering I am using Git Bash.

Have you ever created websites before?
I have worked a bit with client and server in the course network applications so I know a bit about setting
up a server. But i have never tried making a website or worked with websites before. So this will probably be
a fun challenge working with some new languages.

Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.
As written above, I had some experience of web application development in a previous course. But other than
that, this is pretty new for me. I know some stuff about it like Websockets and Restful APIs, but I have never
worked with Visual Studio Code or anything like that before. 

What is your TIL for this course section?
My TIL for this course section is mainly some new commands in Git Bash. I learned about the Github Pages aswell
as some new commands in Git Bash such as tags. I also learned how to manage this program I am writing this in,
Visual Studio Code.
